# Neural Networks

## ðŸ’¡ About Project
This project utilizes the predictive capabilities of neural networks to provide solutions and answers to various problems in various fields.

## ðŸ’¡ Problems

- **Bank Marketing**
  Here we use bank marketing data to predict whether a customer subscribes to a term deposit.
  The problem is binary(yes/no).

- **Drug Recommendations**
  This project leverages the capabilities of neural networks to predict the type of drug recommended for a patient based on demographic and medical data.
  This problem is a Multiclass problem(drugY,drugC,drugX,drugB,drugA)
  - ðŸ‘‰ [Drug Recommendations.ipynb](https://github.com/SHIVOGOJOHN/Neural-Networks/tree/main/Drug%20Recommendations).

- **Real Estate**
  Here we predict the price of houses with respect to various factors.
  This is a regression problem(price in $)
